# MAME4droid-2024

MAME4droid 2024 is developed by David Valdeita (Seleuco) as a port of the MAME 0.268 emulator by MAMEDev and contributors. It emulates arcade games and systems like ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX etc. This version of MAME support over 40000 different ROMs.

* MAME4droid is an EMULATOR and DOES NOT INCLUDE ROMS OR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL OF ANY KIND. 

(NOTE: MAME4droid is not supported, nor does it have anything to do with Mame's team. Don't bother them with questions about MAME4droid)  

This version of MAME4droid was designed to be used with high-end Android devices because it is based on the latest PC MAME version which requires higher specifications than the older versions. 

Even with a high-end device, do not expect "modern" arcade games from the 90s and beyond to necessarily work at full speed or compatibility.   

With over 40000 games and system supported, some games will run better than others; some games may not run at all. It is impossible to support such a vast number of titles, so please do not email me asking for support for a specific game. 

After installing, place your MAME-titled zipped ROMs in /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.seleuco.mame4d2024/files/roms folder (Read the help to see other possibilities for reading your ROMs). 

This MAME4droid version uses only '0.268' romset.
