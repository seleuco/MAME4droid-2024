      <h3>Supported Games<br>
      </h3>
      <p>MAME4droid 2024 uses game ROMs from the MAME '0.268' ROM set (Agoust 2024). Note: This is different than the ROMs used in <em>MAME4droid (0.139u1)</em>. These ROMs cannot be used interchangeably.</p>
      <h3>ROM Location and Naming Convention</h3>
      <p>ROMs should be placed in the &quot;roms&quot; folder of your MAME4droid installation folder. In a default install of MAME4droid, this path is <em>/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/ com.seleuco.mame4d2024/files/roms</em>. You should copy your roms from a PC using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool</p>

	  <p>Alternatively, you can select the external storage option at the MAME4droid installation time and indicate a directory where your roms are or are going to be stored. The roms will be slower to read but they will not be deleted when you uninstall the application. You can also copy them with a android file manager.</p>
	  <p> Additionally, you can copy other selected resources such artworks/samples into directories under the external storage ROMs folder so that they are also read from the external storage.
	  Also, if you are an advanced user, you can modify the .ini files on the main installation folder and configure everything on external storage</p>

	       <p>Anyway, ROMs may be stored anywhere you like in a later time, but you'll need to go to <em>Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Change ROMs path</em></p>

	  <strong>Note:</strong> File and directory names are case-sensitive. MRDO.ZIP is not the same  as mrdo.zip. Always use ZIPped ROMs with filenames in lower case..<br>
      </p>
