<p><strong>Welcome to MAME4droid 2024</strong></p>
    <p>MAME4droid 2024 is developed by David Valdeita (Seleuco) as a port of the latest desktop MAME emulator by MAMEDev and contributors. It emulates arcade games and systems supported by this version of MAME which includes over 40000 different systems.</p>
    <p>This version of MAME4droid was designed to be used with high-end Android devices because it is based on the PC MAME version which requires higher specifications than the older versions.</p>
    <p>Even with a high end device, do not expect &quot;modern&quot; arcade games from the 90s and beyond to necessarily work at full speed or compatibility.</p>
    <p>With over 40000 systems supported, some games will run better than others; some games may not run at all. It is impossible to support such a vast number of titles, so please do not email the developer asking for support for a specific game.</p>
    <p>If you have a lower end Android device, you will find <a class="link"  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seleuco.mame4droid" target="new"><em>MAME4droid (0.139u1)</em></a> to be much faster - but it supports fewer, older ROMs and more games will require sound samples for a complete audio experience.</p>
    <p>MAME4droid will do nothing without having at least one compatible ROM to emulate. Your first step should be to obtain compatible ROM files and place them in the designated ROMs folder (see <a class="link"  href="installation.htm" rel="external">Installation</a> for more information).Official web page for news, source code & additional information <a class="link" href="https://github.com/seleuco" target="new">MAME4droid official site</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Technical Note</strong>: This version doesn't have an UML back-end ARM64 dynamic recompiler, which means drivers based on high spec arcade CPUs won't be playable 
      (even if they did run, the games would be prohibitively slow anyway).</p>
    <p>The MAME and MAME4droid licenses can be found in the <a class="link" href="license.htm" rel="external">Licenses</a> section.</p>
